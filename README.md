Streamlit app which helps you calculate the effect of lockdown in the wake of CoViD-19 (Corona) virus pandemic
1. You can move the contacts slider to see the affect of reduced interaction on total infection and critical cases 
2. You can see how under resourced the country is in terms of ICUs
3. In the sidebar choose the lockdown date (or any date of a later stage if you want a short term analysis)
4. Chart shows the "Expected" infections from the SIR model and real world "Confirmed" infections
5. Move the slider so that the circles for Expected and Confirmed come as close as possible to eachother (I will later replace this with curve_fit)
6. The value will automatically be transferred to the main UI window "Contacts" slider.
7. Italy's original (before lockdown),the number for contacts was ~19 (compare how this compares with the number of "Contacts" after lockdown)
8. Now move the "Contacts" slider on the main UI page to guess how long this may last and how many can get critically ill if not done so.
9. Kepp safe everyone
